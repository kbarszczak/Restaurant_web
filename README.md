This project is a simple web application for restaurant services such as online orders and reservations. Moreover, the application is also an informational card for the restaurant. It is a complete system with a backend written in Java and a frontend written in Angular. The application provides the layout for a guest, user, and admin.

## Motivation

This project was made to learn the Angular framework and make me more familiar and skilled with the Java Spring Boot framework.

## Build Status

1. The backend is a read-to-use complete application
2. The frontend is not completely finished. There are missing layout features for guest and admin view. Moreover, the frontend source code may be significantly improved.
